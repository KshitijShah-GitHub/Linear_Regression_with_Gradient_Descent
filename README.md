# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
A Jupyter Notebook that contains my first attempt at using gradient descent to find the line of best fit to generated data

There are a lot of explanations for what I'm doing every step of the way in the notebook for future reference and clarity.

I also included a python file of the code as well.

NOTE: Some of the LaTeX isn't rendering completely in GitHub ipynb viewer so for best results, download the notebook and open with Jupyter Notebook.

Here's a pretty picture of what the code is leading up to ![Grad Desc Image]("https://github.com/KshitijShah-GitHub/Linear_Regression_with_Gradient_Descent/blob/master/GD1.png")
